Dragon Tongue to text
Version 1.0

Enter the Dragon text in the top textarea. In the bottom left textarea the
Dragon characters will be converted to Latin characters. In the bottom right
textarea the translation of the text will be displayed. Words that are bold
couldn't be translated.

The dictionary that is used to translate the Dragon language is stored in
dict.js. You can edit or add new words to that file to update the dictionary.

At the bottom there are buttons below the header "Snippets". After pressing one 
of these buttons the content of the top textarea is replaced with the selected
snippet. The snippets are predefined snippets of Dragon text that were found
earlier. You can edit or add the snippets in snippets.js.

Compatible with Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 7.
Under Internet Explorer 6/7/8 new characters will always be put at the end.
Chrome doesn't render the "space"-character properly.
